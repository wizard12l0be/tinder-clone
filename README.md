# Tinder Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

Quarantine has started making me feel a bit bored, so I thought it was time to learn react. This project is part of my learn js/reactjs through developing mini apps. This build in particular was done by following CleverProgrammer's [Let's Build a TINDER Clone with REACT JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQfeB_FKKkc) Youtube video.

They have other videos such as an Amazon clone, Tiktok clone, WhatsApp clone etc. Good for beginners who want to learn reactjs by example.

Aside from ReactJS, this also connects to a firebase cloud firestore database.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`
3. No dependency tracker has been added yet, may add in future builds to make sure others can download

### Dependencies used
